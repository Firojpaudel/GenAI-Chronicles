Therefore, it can be defined as a static method because it doesn't require access to the instance (self) of the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism:** In the Transformer model, the attention mechanism is split into multiple heads. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. Each head has its own set of weights and performs its own attention calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reshaping for Parallel Computation:** The original shape of the tensors `query, key, and value` is `(Batch_size, seq_len, d_model)`. `d_model` is the dimension of the model, which is split into `h` heads, each with a dimension of `d_k` (where $d_{k} = \\frac{d_{model}}{h}$). By reshaping the tensors to `(Batch_size, seq_len, h, d_k)`, we prepare them for parallel computation across the multiple heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transposing for Efficient Computation:** After reshaping, we transpose the tensors to `(Batch_size, h, seq_len, d_k)`.\n",
        "This transposition ensures that the heads are the second dimension, which allows for efficient computation of attention scores across the heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then lets talk about  the contiguous memory allocation. The `.contiguous()` function ensures that the tensor's memory layout is suitable for the next operation `(view)`. This step is necessary because transpose can result in non-contiguous memory storage, which is incompatible with reshaping.\n",
